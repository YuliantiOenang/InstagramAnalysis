4. Is good for posting post sequential? Based on like score
Likes score will decrease until 8% if the user send post sequentially The idea is sorting data based on user uuid and date posted, I want to compare the data today and yesterday, is there any increment in the like score. If there is an increment, then I labelled it to true, vice versa. To drive conclusion, I calculate how much true (like score increases), and how much the false I got the false is more than the true ones

The next question is how much is the impact of sending posts sequentially? To answer that question, I make calculation on:
(avg Likes Score value of sequential post - avg Likes Score value of non sequential post) / avg Likes Score value of non sequential post

- Can Likes Score derive from Likes?
Likes Score didn't related to likes and days passed for post
